### Hey there! Welcome to the Command Manager! 

This is a cool little web tool I whipped up to help you organize commands, group them into batches, and even mess around with temporary domain changes. The default domain is `target.com`, but you can swap it out with whatever you want—don’t worry, it resets when you refresh! Let’s dive in.

### How to Get It Going

Yo, here’s the easy setup:

- Grab the code by cloning the repo: `git clone https://github.com/siuxsa/Command_Manager.git`
- Jump into the folder: `cd Command_Manager`
- Open `command manager pro.html` in your browser—Chrome or Firefox works great. Just double-click it or use `file:///path/to/command manager pro.html`. No fancy server needed!

### How to Use It

Alright, let’s play with it!

- Fire up `command manager pro.html` in your browser.
- Wanna add a batch? Hit "Options" then "Add Batch" and name it.
- Got a batch? Click the little ⋮ next to it to edit, delete, or move it up/down.
- Add command groups with "Options" > "Add Command Group," then toss in commands with the input boxes and "Add Command" button. Use "Actions" to tweak or move those groups.
- Wanna test a domain? Type something like `example.com` in the "Target Domain" box and hit "Analyze." It’ll swap `target.com` everywhere for now.
- Refresh the page, and it’s back to `target.com`—magic!
- Toggle between all commands or just the batch you’re on with the "Toggle View" button.

### What’s Cool About It?

- You can add, edit, delete, and sort batches like a boss.
- Command groups? Same deal—add, edit, delete, sort.
- Commands get notes, copying, and sorting too.
- That domain swap? Temporary and fun—reverts on refresh.
- Active batch lights up so you know what’s cooking.
- Data sticks around in local storage (except the domain stuff).
- UI’s pretty slick with dropdowns and copy buttons.
